/**
 * Method annotation which ensures that the SignedTicket passed to the
 * method as part of the requests is validated before the method is executed.
 * In order for the validation to work the following is needed:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A request object (extending com.eurodyn.qlack2.fuse.common.rest.QRequest) passed
 * as argument to the annotated method. The index of this argument in the method signature
 * is specified by the requestIndex argument of the annotation. The default is 0
 * since in the general case this will be the only argument of the method.</li>
 * <li>An IDMService object which will be used to perform the validation. This is
 * retrieved via reflection from the class containing the annotated method. The name
 * of the class field holding the service is specified via tha idmServiceField argument
 * of the annotation (the default is "idmService")</li>
 * </ul>
